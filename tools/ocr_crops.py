"""OCR the routes: crop every `ocr` route router-cli gives and read it with Tesseract, caching each result.

For each route, the page is rendered with PyMuPDF over the route's box and 6 pt round it, in grey, turned so
its own text runs left to right (a page with /Rotate can read sideways as displayed): an image route at
the image's own resolution (its dpi from the router, kept between 300 and 400), outlined and garbled text
at 300 dpi. Tesseract reads the crop (TSV output, one word per line with its box and confidence), and the
words' boxes are mapped back to points on the page as displayed (after /Rotate, like the router's).
Tesseract runs with OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1, so the same crop always gives the same words, and its TSV is
cached under data/ocr-cache by a hash of the crop's PNG and the Tesseract settings: a rerun that renders
the same crops calls Tesseract for none of them.

Tesseract refuses an image more than 32,767 px on a side. A crop that would be longer (a well log can be
14,000 pt tall, 70,000 px at 360 dpi) is read in strips across its long side, at the same resolution, each
at most STRIP_PX long and overlapping the next by STRIP_OVERLAP points. Each strip is a crop of its own in
the output (with "strip": [k, n]), and a word is kept only by the strip whose own share of the box holds
the word's centre, so a word in an overlap is counted once. A crop under the limit is read as before.

With --pages, each whole page is one crop instead (source "page", 300 dpi), whatever the router says:
the baseline of OCR'ing every page, read the same way. Each crop's Tesseract time, in seconds, is kept
next to its cached TSV; a crop cached before times were kept is read again to time it, and the new TSV
must match the cached one.

With --engine=ppocrv6, PP-OCRv6 (Apache 2.0, ONNX on CPU) reads the crops instead of Tesseract. It runs in
its own Python environment (paddleocr with onnxruntime; no Paddle framework), named by the PPOCR_PYTHON
environment variable, as one long-lived tools/ppocr_worker.py per worker thread, each on one CPU thread.
--ppocr-tier=tiny|small|medium (default small) and --ppocr-side (the detector's long side in pixels,
default 960) choose the model. PP-OCRv6 gives text lines, so each line's box is shared among its words by
their lengths in characters; its score (0 to 1) is written as 0 to 100, Tesseract's scale. Its results are
cached apart from Tesseract's, under a key that includes the model and settings.
